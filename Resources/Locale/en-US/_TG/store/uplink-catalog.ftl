# Bloodred Modsuit
uplink-modsuit-bloodred-name = CSA-99MS "Deimos" Modsuit
uplink-modsuit-bloodred-desc = Mass produced, low-protection replacement for the average blood-red in case you lack the funds to buy a real one. It is more versatile than the average bloodred, but it will protect you way less in a fight. A fancy piece of technology to show off to your Syndicate friends.

# Elite Modsuit
uplink-modsuit-elitemodsuit-name = CSA-122MS "Phobos" Modsuit
uplink-modsuit-elitemodsuit-desc = A mass production modular take on the Elite suit. It trades a lot of the Elite suit's enhanced protection for modular equipment gear. It offers unparalleled protection from energy weapons, but its ballistic protection leaves much to be desired.
